## About me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @melchiorhering a Bsc Information Sciences student at the Universiteit van Amsterdam. 
I am interested in Technology, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. I'm currently writing my Thesis about predicting traffic accidents based on historical spatiotemporal-data about registered traffic accidents in the Netherlands.
For my Thesis I am learning about Deep-Neural networks and machine learning models that can cope with this kind of data.
